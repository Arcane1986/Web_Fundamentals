  <article><h3>My Story</h3>
  <p>	The year was 2004 and I was a freshman at the University of Florida. Like most college students, I was 
    very unclear on my path in life and which way to go on my journey. I had always found math subjects to be
    particularly in my wheelhouse, but I also found the biological sciences very intriguing. It was around this
    time I met my future roommate James. James was pre-med and told me about all his plans to become a doctor.
    The way he painted the picture I felt like this sounded like the path for me.</p>
  <p>Fast forward four years or so and I found myself graduating from college with a bachelor’s in science with 
    all my pre-med prerequisites completed and nothing to stop me but the MCAT. I moved back to Tampa, where I was 
    from, and began studying for the MCAT while working at Tampa General Hospital. Throughout my time there I met 
    resident after resident. I was working in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit and it was typical to meet a new 
    set of residents every month. One common bit of advice I kept getting from the residents about becoming a 
    doctor was, ironically, don’t do it. The most common piece of advice I started receiving was to become a 
    physician’s assistant or nurse practitioner instead.</p>
  <p>Near the end of my time at Tampa General Hospital I took the MCAT and was set to apply to medical school but 
    something in me didn’t feel right. After hearing so many displease people in their profession and regularly 
    talking to a friend of mine who was miserable in medical school, I had decided to change my career path and 
    pursue a physician’s assistant program.</p>
  <p>In the spring of 2013 I found myself working at WellCare Health plans in the pharmacy department. Here I was 
    fortunate enough to take advantage of their tuition reimbursement and start to finish the prerequisites for PA 
    school. Ironically, I had taken enough courses to go to medical school but not PA school. By the time I finished
    all but one course, I started a new job at MedHOK Inc, a start-up technology company. MedHOK was the most 
    unique job I had held since I started working at the age of 16. The job required me to use my existing 
    knowledge of health care, but I also had to learn to utilize it from a technological point of view. When 
    I started everything was so foreign to me but at the same time, so interesting. I found myself thriving at my
    job and felt right at home working at a tech company.</p>
  <p>After about two years of working at MedHOK, I found myself craving more. I had this innate ability to 
    understand code, but I did not have the abilities to read or write it myself. Often, I found myself offering 
    solutions to developers for defects they couldn’t seem to resolve. The more and more experience I obtained the
    more and more I started to try to write my requirements to better help the development team understand my asks.
    I was starting to consider going back to school to seek a degree in Computer Science when a rare opportunity
    came in the form of an email one day. Hearst, the company who now owned MedHOK, had sent out information
    about a program that would afford the opportunity for their tech employees a chance to become a developer
    without the need to go back to school. The program was called SEED which stood for Software Engineering
    Education and Development. The SEED program gave employees the chance to go to a coding boot camp in 
    place of their normal 9 – 5 jobs with an internship with the development team waiting once the camp is 
    completed. So here I am now writing this, working towards becoming a developer and could not be any 
    happier!</p></article>
